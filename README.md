# Titanic visualization
##Summary
On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 people.This sensational tragedy shocked the world.My visualization will show you the comparison in different Pclass between life and death.Let us use data to revisit that catastrophe again.
##Design
###Initial idea
Comparison between the survivors and the dead is the core idea of this visualization.Since the Pclass is a very important thing to affect surviving or not,I use barplot to count the number of survivors and the dead in different Pclass.I use other variables like sex and age as an option to show the visualization to strenthen the comparison.
###Changes after
